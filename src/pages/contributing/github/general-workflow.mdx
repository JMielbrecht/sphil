# General GitHub Workflow

### Basic Setup

Forking a repository on GitHub involves creating your copy of someone else's repository. It's a fundamental feature of GitHub that allows you to contribute to projects, experiment with changes, or use the code as a starting point for your own project.

1. **Creating a Fork:** On GitHub, you'll find a "Fork" button on the top right of a repository page. Clicking this creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    subgraph AA [github.com]
    id1[(Source Repository)] --> id2[Your Copy on GitHub];
    end
```

2. **Your Copy:** The forked repository now exists in your GitHub account, and you can make changes to it without affecting the original repository. You can clone this fork to your local machine and start working on it just like you would with any other repository.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    subgraph AA [github.com]
    id1[Your Copy on GitHub];
    end
    id1[Your Copy on GitHub] --> id2[Your Local Copy]
```

3. **Cloning**: To create a local copy, find the "Clone or download" button on your GitHub repository page. Clicking this button reveals a URL that you can use to clone the repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command. The full command looks like this:

```bash
git clone <url>
```

Notice that the repository on your local machine and the repository on GitHub are now linked, but they *do not sync automatically*. To achieve this, you must manually push and pull changes between them using the `git push` and `git pull` commands.

### Making Changes

The basic workflow for making changes to a repository is as follows:

1. **Create a Branch:** When you're working on a project, you're going to want to create a branch for each new feature or bug fix you implement. This keeps your changes organized and allows you to work on multiple features at once without affecting the main codebase. To create a branch, use the `git checkout` command with the `-b` flag:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

2. **Make Changes:** Once you've created a branch, you can start making changes to the codebase. You can use the `git status` command to see which files have been modified, and the `git diff` command to see the exact changes you've made. When you're ready to commit your changes, use the `git add` command to add the files you want to commit, and the `git commit` command to commit them:

```bash
git add <file1> <file2> ... # or `git add .` to add all files
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

3. **Push Changes:** Once you've committed your changes, you can push them to your GitHub repository using the `git push` command:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

4. **Create a Pull Request:** Once you've pushed your changes to your GitHub repository, you can create a pull request to merge them into the main codebase. To do this, go to your repository page on GitHub and click the "New pull request" button. This will take you to a page where you can review your changes and create a pull request.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    subgraph AA [github.com]
    id1[Your Copy on GitHub] --> id2{Pull Request}
    id2{Pull Request} --> id3[(Source Repository)];
    end
```

Note that any changes you make to your local repository after creating a pull request will be included in the pull request automatically. This means that you can continue working on your branch while the pull request is being reviewed.

Note also that you any changes you do locally must be pushed to your GitHub repository before they can be included in the pull request.

5. **Review Changes:** Once you've created a pull request, you can review your changes and make sure everything looks good before merging them into the main codebase. You can also use this time to discuss your changes with other contributors and make sure everyone is on the same page.

6. **Merge Changes:** Once you and the collaborators are happy with your changes, you can merge them into the main codebase using the "Merge pull request" button on GitHub (or this will be done by one of the maintainers). This will merge your changes into the main codebase and close the pull request.

Note that you can only merge a pull request if there are no conflicts between your changes and the main codebase. If there are conflicts, you will need to resolve them before you can merge the pull request.

### Staying Up to Date

When you're working on a project, it's important to stay up to date with the latest changes in the main codebase. This ensures that your changes are compatible with the latest version of the codebase, and that you don't accidentally overwrite someone else's work.

To sync your GitHub forked copy with the source repository, you can click the sync button on your GitHub repository page. This will pull changes from the main codebase into your GitHub repository, and allow you to continue working on your branch without affecting the main codebase.

To stay up to date between your GitHub copy and local copy, you can use the `git pull` command to pull changes from the main codebase into your local repository. This will merge any changes that have been made since you last pulled into your local repository, and allow you to continue working on your branch without affecting the main codebase.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Note that if you have uncommitted changes in your local repository, you will need to commit them before you can pull changes from the main codebase.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    What if you have worked on some changes in your local codebase but meanwhile there has been an update on the source repository? You can use the <code>git stash</code> command to temporarily store your changes, sync your GitHub copy with the source repository, pull the latest changes from the GitHub copy down to your local repository, and then apply your changes on top of them. Or, alternatively, after syncing your GitHub copy with the source repository, you can commit your current changes and then pull the changes from your remote GitHub copy down to your local repository, which will merge the incoming changes with yours. Note that conflics may arise in both cases, which you will need to resolve manually.

### Resolving Conflicts

When you merge a pull request, GitHub will automatically try to merge your changes into the main codebase. If there are any conflicts between your changes and the main codebase, GitHub will notify you and allow you to resolve them manually.

To resolve conflicts, you can use the `git merge` command to merge the main codebase into your local repository. This will allow you to resolve any conflicts manually before merging your changes into the main codebase.

```bash
git merge origin main
```

                    sPhil. By day he works as a software developer, and by night

                    of Warwick. The title of his thesis was Hegel&apos;s{" "}
                    <em>
                        Critique of Determinism: Justifying Unfreedom as a
                        Moment of Freedom
                    </em>
                    . Filip&apos;s main research areas are systematic
                    philosophy, metaphysics, ontology, essence, freedom,
                    determinism, and maintains an otherwise broad interest in
                    all the dimensions of intelligence and reason. Filip is also
                    an incurable fan of the art and poetry of William Blake.

                    Ahilleas Rokni, Ph.D., is a co-founder and the business lead
                    of sPhil. He completed his PhD thesis in philosophy in 2022
                    under the supervision of Professor Stephen Houlgate at the
                    University of Warwick. His thesis aimed to give an account
                    of the much-debated move from the <em>Science of Logic</em>{" "}
                    to the <em>Philosophy of Nature</em> in Hegel&apos;s system.
                    Ahilleas&apos;s main research concerns are Hegel&apos;s
                    logic, philosophy of nature, philosophy of science, and
                    aesthetics.

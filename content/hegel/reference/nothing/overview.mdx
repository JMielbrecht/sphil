## Overview of Nothing

Nothing is the second category or determination of Hegel's _Science of Logic_.
It develops out of pure `being` and develops back into it. As with `being`, it
is utterly indeterminate and empty. Here, `nothing` is not to be understood as
absence or the lack of something, since there is no other against which it is
the lack of.

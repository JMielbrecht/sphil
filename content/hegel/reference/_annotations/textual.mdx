## Inline Comments

The en dash (&ndash;) at the start of a sentence (and _not_ within one) is often
used by Hegel to insert a quick comment. It serves to swiftly elaborate on a
logical passage and provide additional guidance. Importantly, in these
mini-commentaries, Hegel steps out of the logical development to reflect upon
it. Often, immediately after the en dash Hegel begins to speak about extraneous
matter to the logical development or uses less precise language, such as in the
development of [`being`](/articles/hegel/reference/being/development).

Here "intuiting" and "speaking of" do not seem appropriate for the purely
logical development. If it is correct that the en dash signals the start of a
brief commentary here, then it makes sense why Hegel begins to employ intuition
and vague language like "speaking of", since he is now reflecting upon the
matter at hand as it has been developed thus far and attempts to help his
readers to understand an otherwise extremely abstract idea.

If the en dash does not signal the start of a comment and the logical
development still continues, then that invites interpretation as to the precise
status of intuition this early in the logic of pure thinking.

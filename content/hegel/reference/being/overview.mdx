## Overview of Being

Being is the first category or determination of Hegel's _Science of Logic_. It
is the most indeterminate and immediate category. One might add that it is also
the simplest determination, if one can even speak of determination. Its
indeterminacy and immediacy makes difficult to grasp and distinguish from
nothing.

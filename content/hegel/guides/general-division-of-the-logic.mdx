_The Science of Logic_ is divided into two major parts or three doctrines. In
accordance with the major parts, the _Logic_ is divided into _objective logic_
and _subjective logic_. The objective logic contains the doctrines: _The
Doctrine of Being_ and _The Doctrine of Essence_, and the subjective logic
contains _The Doctrine of the Concept_. Each of these doctrines deal with the
development of logic in predominant descriptors, such as immediate existence,
mediated or reflected determinations and explicit conceptual thought. In other
words, each of these doctrines operate in ways that distinguish what is
logically understood whether the matter is fundamentally immediate, mediated or
a developmental integration of both.

Hegel warns at the very start of the section General Division of The
Logic&mdash;just following the
[Introduction](/articles/hegel/guides/science-of-logic-introduction)&mdash;that
these divisions between parts and doctrines do not serve to philosophically
determine the content of logic ahead of time, but are rather preliminary aids to
help orient the reader. They are, therefore, pedagogical in nature and the full
disclosure of the actual development is only found in following each
determination or concept carefully from its beginning to its end.

With that in mind, one can quickly get a basic lay of the land and get a sense
of the project's key manuevers. Given that the logic will develop into the
`concept`, whose logic is explicitly developmental, it becomes understood that
the preceding doctrines are _moments_ of its development and are as such not as
self-standing as they first were understood to be&mdash;indeed, Hegel's argument
is that these categories or determinations are internally inadequate. This means
that everything in the logic becomes oriented around the `concept` and, finally,
the `idea`. The `idea` then further develops into space and time, nature, human
minded activity, but these are beyond the scope of pure thought, which is what
the _Science of Logic_ is concerned with.

> Therefore the earlier determinations which (on the _pathway to truth_)
> _existed for themselves_, as for instance, that of subjective and objective,
> or also of thought and being, of concept and reality, no matter from what
> standpoint they were determined, are _now in their truth_, that is, in their
> unity, _reduced to forms_. In their difference they therefore implicitly
> remain, _in themselves_, the whole concept, and this concept is posited in the
> division only under its own determinations (Hegel 2010, 39/21.45).

_The objective logic_ contains the Doctrines of Being and Essence. The former
concerns determinations or concepts that are typically understood to exist
immediately, such as `being`, `existence`, `quality`, the ` one`, the `many` and
so forth. The latter has terms typically understood to exist mediately, such as
`essence`, `shine`, `difference`, `ground`, `form`, `content`, `appearance`,
`relation`, `actuality`, `causality` and son. In more technical terms, the
entire part is the concept _implicitly in itself_.

_The subjective logic_, on the other hand, concerns explicitly conceptual
determinations, such as `universality`, `particularity`, `singularity`,
`judgment`, `inference`, `means`, `purpose`, `cognition` and many more. This is
the concept _that exists for itself_.

### A Dialectic of the Divisions

The Objective- and Subjective Logic is essentially the first broad division made
of the _Science of Logic_. However, as Hegel notes, being and the concept do not
stand wholly apart from each other but are related. Indeed, their very
difference logically establishes a link between the two. This reference
constitutes a particular logic unto itself that is known as the sphere of
mediation or _The Doctrine of Essence_. As Hegel elaborates:

> [The sphere of mediation is] the concept as a system of _reflected
> determinations_, that is, of being as it passes over into the in-itselfness of
> the concept &ndash; a concept which is in this way not yet posited for itself
> _as such_ but also fettered by an immediate being still external to it (Hegel
> 2010, 40/21.46).

The _difference_ between being and thought necessitates a third element between
them and so it is more precise to divide the logic into three doctrines rather
than two parts. Hegel also notes that with essence the stalwart objectivity of
being is progressively denigrated to include the inwardness of the concept;
however, precisely for that very reason, the concept is unable to be made fully
explicit while the immediacy of being persists. Essence is therefore the
purgation of the concept, as it were, since the concept is actively failing to
be the concept proper while being remains something immediately external to it
and so must overcome these failures by the discovery of a logic that is not
bound by mere difference.

## Further Remarks

### On the Term Element

Hegel highlights the term _element_ when discussing the unity of the doctrines.
As George di Giovanni notes in his translation, element has classical
connotations harkening back to the four elements of "air", "water", "earth" and
"fire" where it is understood that something has an underlying nature of its own
_but also_ has implied modes of being or relationships to other elements (Hegel
2010, 39). In Aristotle, we find element defined as:

> An element, we take it, is a body into which other bodies may be analysed,
> present in them potentially or in actuality (which of these, is still
> disputable), and not itself divisible into bodies different in form (Aristotle
> 2001, On the Heavens, Book III, Chapter III).

As far as Aristotle was concerned then, an element cannot be divided into bodies
of a different form, such that if one were to divide "air", one would not
receive "fire" or "earth". Whether this is still valid for Hegel is not clear
here, but what is clear is that logic principally understood as element persists
throughout its many divisions or transformations and is therefore _the_ unity.

However, what might contrast to the thinking of element as a kind of "building
block" is the fact that the logical developments of the concept are
non-regressive. That is to say, the progression of thought cannot be reverted
back to its constituents. As Hegel confirms:

> For since the division is ... the _parting_ or the _judgment_ of the concept
> &ndash; is the positing of the determination which is already immanent in it
> and therefore the positing of its distinction &ndash; this positing must not
> be understood as resolving that concrete unity back into its determinations,
> as if these were to exist on their own, for this would be here a vacuous
> return to the previous standpoint, to the opposition of consciousness. But
> this opposition has vanished; the unity remains the element, and the
> distinctions of the division and of the development in general no longer
> transgress that unity (Hegel 2010, 39/21.45).

Positing&mdash;here meaning putting something as explicit&mdash;develops the
content further and reveals new details about it. This further account cannot be
said to be part of the constituents as they were but must be part of them as
they develop. In the context of thought and consciousness, the latter is
oriented around an subject-object opposition whereas in thought, by contrast,
this opposition has _vanished_, leaving logic as the sole element of which any
further distinctions and classifications form moments.

### Logic from Kant to Hegel (Niklas)

Hegel compares his logic and its constituents to Kant's and notes some
differences. First, without controversy, Kant makes a distinction between
general logic and transcendental logic, the latter being the logic concerning
experience or cognition (or how objects appear) whilst the former being the
logic that concerns logic as such. For Kant, while transcendental logic may be
erroneous or differ depending on the kind of creature that is in question (human
being, God, alien, etc.), general logic can never be in error. Said otherwise,
my cognitive apparatus generates a particular kind of experience of the world
that is peculiar to me _as a human being_ and outside of which I cannot make any
truthful claims about the world and its object; but these experiences or claims
must accord with the rules of general logic, such that I cannot have an
experience that would ever violate general logic. General logic alone, in
contrast, is insufficient to provide any positive claims about the world and its
objects.

Second, and perhaps more controversially, Hegel claims Kant's principal aim to
is to vindicate the categories (or determinations) for self-consciousness
understood as the subjective `I`, and because of this "his point of view remains
confined within consciousness and its opposition, and, besides the empirical
element of feeling and intuition, is left with something else not posited or
determined by thinking self-consciousness, a _thing-in-itself_" (Hegel 2010,
41/21.47). Here Hegel claims that Kant's method is confined within
consciousness, which for Hegel is always something oriented through a
subject-object dichotomy, such that it is systematically limited. He then points
to two other elements that must be externally given for the system to be
coherent: the _empirical_ element of feelings and intuition and the element of a
thing-in-itself. If Kant's aim is to vindicate the categories of
_self-consciousness_, then inserting anything empirical or of what is
essentially non-categorical in nature, is at least problematic. Moreover, the
other element of a thing-in-itself is definitively not empirical and yet it must
follow from the transcendental analysis since the human being is prone to misuse
the categories of the understanding, such that from the presupposition of
something empirical follows something wholly non-empirical.

Third, the objectification of the `I`, or what could be called the real process
whereby the `I` becomes a representation for itself, can be understood as an
"original and necessary deed of consciousness" (Hegel 2010, 41/21.47) such that
this essentially precedes the subject-object dichotomy integral to
consciousness. But then this should not be called consciousness anymore, Hegel
says, since consciousness is explicitly that for which "holds within itself the
opposition of the 'I', and its intended object which is not to be found in that
original deed" (Hegel 2010, 41/21.47-48). Where this opposition has ceased the
matter should not be termed consciousness but thought.

We see here that for all the shortcomings of Kant's system (if Hegel is right),
there are key links in the manner both these philosophers build their systems.
Where Kant essentially begins with what is most immediate to
consciousness&mdash;pure intuitions of space and time&mdash;Hegel refines these
categories further to those that concern immediacy pure and simple, such as
`being` and `nothing`. Gone is the presupposition of an empirical reality where
the examination of pure thought is concerned, there is only, minimally, the
immediate being of that thought&mdash;which is exactly _not_ external to that
thought (see also
[Presuppositionless Thinking](/articles/hegel/guides/presuppositionless-thinking)).
Now, this is not to deny that there is such a thing as empirical reality, but
following Hegel's systematic development, whatever empirical reality turns out
to be, it cannot be less than
[immediate being, which _also_ overlaps with thought](/articles/hegel/guides/science-of-logic-introduction#logic-as-non-metaphysical),
such that this category is shared between empirical reality and thought. This
solves the problem of mediation between thought and being, or subjectivity and
objectivity, since from the start the least that empirical reality can be is
also minimally conceptual or logical.

Furthermore, if it is true that the objectification of the `I` (Hegel likely has
Kant's principle of the synthetic unity of apperception in mind here) is the
_deed_ of self-consciousness that brings to the fore the `I` as represented for
itself, then here we have something essentially self-determining, and with Hegel
equating it to thinking as such, there seems to be a strong correlation here
between this deed and Hegel's own account of `the concept`. However, Kant's
conception of the concept (if this correlation obtains) is marred with baggage
of empirical intuition whose precise status vis-Ã -vis concepts is left wanting
as well as the specter of the thing-in-itself, such that its conceptual method
never really comes to light.

> Now because the interest of the Kantian philosophy was directed to the
> so-called _transcendental_ nature of the categories, the treatment itself of
> such categories came up empty. What they are in themselves apart from their
> abstract relation to the "I," a relation which is the same for all, how they

> advanced by this philosophy (Hegel 2010, 41/21.48).

If the treatment of the categories comes up empty, then there is essentially no
developmental understanding at play and therefore `the concept` is itself
lacking. Kant only stumbles, as it were, over the concept following his
transcendental inquiry&mdash;but it speaks to the _power_ of Kant's thought that
he is, despite systematic limitations, able to discover and appreciate the
underlying conceptual movement necessarily at work in pure intuitions and
categories of the understanding.

Finally, Hegel deals with the Kantian thing-in-itself as part of the dialectical
development of logic, particularly in the Doctrine of Essence where this
determination receives its treatment in both as the thing in itself and as the
world in and for itself. Here it is seen how this determination necessarily
follows from the determination of thing, and subsequently from the world that
appears, but that it also then becomes later sublated in the following
`essential relation` between the world that appears and the world that is in and
for itself. Now, this actually serves to vindicate Kant somewhat since the idea
of the thing-in-itself, even in Hegel's own estimate, necessary follows from the
logical development and therefore cannot be, as Hegel repeatedly writes,
something external or alien to thinking.[^1]

[^1]:
    One could come to Hegel's defense here and say that it is _how_ Kant treats
    the thing-in-itself which makes abstract and alien to thought, but given
    Hegel's frequent assaults on the very idea of a thing-in-itself, this
    defense seems weak.

### The Objective Logic Replaces Former Metaphysics

Hegel states that the objective logic takes the place of former metaphysics
inasmuch as that was a metaphysics that understood reality purely in terms of
ideas and principles. More specifically, Hegel's objective logic aims to
supplant ontology in the classical sense of being the philosophical treatment of
things (_ens_). There are, however, a number of other ideas and principles that
the older metaphysics were very concerned with but that Hegel's ontology will
jettison, such as the soul, the world, God, and others.[^2] In Hegel's estimate,
these ideas are subjects of _figurative imagination_ rather than categories of
thought and his aim is to conduct his examination of the categories of thought
free from the intermingling of figurative or representational content.

Hegel praises Kant for leveraging the just reproach on the older metaphysics
which employed the forms of thought, pure or mixed with figurative content,
_uncritically_, without first conducting an investigation into the nature of
knowing and its limits. Hegel claims, following the spirit of Kant in being
self-critical in one's considerations, that his objective logic is the true
critique of the ideas and principles of ontology. In contrast to Kant, however,
Hegel will not consider these ideas _in light of_ cognition or from the vantage
point of a system of _a priori_ (before the fact) and _a posteriori_ (after the
fact), but simply from their own innate content. This is to say, Hegel will not,
for example, consider the idea of existence from the standpoint of human
cognition, but from its own standpoint&mdash;what existence _is_ according to
its concept. Hegel does this because this is what it means to be truly critical
about the ontological ideas and principles.

[^2]:
    Hegel also mentions "the world" but his own Doctrine of Essence will examine
    the world that appears and the world in and for itself, so that what he says
    here vis-Ã -vis what his objective logic will investigate exactly is a little
    misleading. Furthermore, the `soul` is treated later in his _Philosophy of
    Spirit_ as well as `God` in his examination of religion, both of which can
    be viewed as extensions of ontology given that the _Philosophy of Spirit_
    systematically follows the _Philosophy of Nature_, which in turn follows the
    _Logic_. However, it is unsettled, or at least unclear, the extent to which
    these later parts of the system concerning _Realphilosophie_ can be
    genuinely considered ontology if ontology concerns the logic of being
    considered in terms of pure thought or in terms of thought as such.

One can get a brief glimpse of the debt Hegel has to Kant's philosophy since it
was Kant that inaugurated a systematic critique of cognition, metaphysics,
ontology and experience that made more precise inroads into the difference
between figurative imagination and conceptual thinking, and thus paved the way
for Hegel's own treatment of ontology and metaphysics with further critical
focus.
